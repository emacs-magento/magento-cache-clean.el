;;; Commentary:

;; Emacs integration for mage-os/magento-cache-clean, a file watcher
;; based cache cleaner for Magento 2.
;;
;; Features:
;; - One-shot cache cleaning via `magento-cache-clean'
;; - Watch mode via `magento-cache-clean-watch' (comint)
;; - Transient UI via `magento-cache-clean-transient'
;; - Auto-detection of Magento root directory
;; - Per-project configuration via .dir-locals.el
;;
;; Commands take a list of cache-clean command line arguments, so they
;; can also be called from Lisp:
;;
;;   (magento-cache-clean '("--keep-generated" "layout"))

;;; Code:

(require 'ansi-color)
(require 'comint)
(require 'compile)
(require 'thunk)
(require 'transient)
